THE WEIGHT OF OCTOBER LIGHT This morning I walked out into the field behind my father's barn. The grass was wet, not with dew exactly, but with that thick moisture that comes in October when the earth begins to remember winter—when the veil between worlds grows thin, as the ancient Celts knew, when Samhain approaches and the gates swing open. I thought about the years I spent running from this place, from the smell of hay and diesel fuel, from the low gray skies that press down on Minnesota like a hand on a child's head. I was like the initiate fleeing the mystery school, not yet understanding that there is no escape from the Great Work, that the alchemical transformation must happen wherever we stand. There's a darkness in me that I've been carrying since I was seven years old. It lives somewhere between my ribs and my spine, a small stone that grew there the day my father came home from the factory and didn't speak for three days—a nigredo, the alchemists would call it, that first blackening, the putrefaction that must precede all transmutation. My mother moved through the kitchen like a ghost, her hands busy with potatoes and bread, but her eyes somewhere else entirely, perhaps in the past, perhaps in some future that never arrived. She was like Sophia in the Gnostic texts, the divine feminine trapped in matter, yearning for the pleroma, for that wholeness that exists beyond the realm of the demiurge. The old Jungians say we carry our father's unlived life in our bodies. I believe this. The Hermeticists understood it too—"as above, so below"—the ancestral patterns descending through the generations like the sephiroth cascading down the Tree of Life. I can feel it in my shoulders when I chop wood, in my hands when I reach for a woman in the dark. There's a longing there that isn't mine, a hunger that belonged to him first, and to his father before him—all the way back to some Norwegian farmer who stood in a field just like this one, staring at the horizon and wondering why his heart felt like a fist. We are links in the golden chain, the Aurea Catena Homeri that connects us to the prima materia of our origins. In the woods near my house there's a clearing where I go to sit. The trees there are mostly oak and ash, their branches reaching up like the arms of drowning men—or like the sacred groves of the Druids, where the axis mundi pierces through to the celestial spheres. I go there when I need to remember that I am not just this body, not just this collection of wounds and memories. The Neoplatonists called this anamnesis, the soul's remembering of its divine origin, its home in the One before the fall into multiplicity. Sometimes I bring a book—Rumi or Kabir or one of the old German mystics, Jakob Böhme with his visions of the Ungrund, Meister Eckhart speaking of the Godhead beyond God—and I read until the words stop making sense and become just sounds, just breath. This is the apophatic way, the via negativa, the path of unknowing that the medieval mystics walked. Yesterday I saw a hawk circling over the field. It rode the thermals with such ease, such ancient knowledge—like the solar birds in alchemical emblems, like Horus ascending, like the pneuma riding the currents between heaven and earth. I thought about how we've forgotten how to do that, how to ride the currents of our own lives without fighting, without that constant exhaustion that comes from swimming against the tide. The Taoists knew this, and so did the Renaissance magi who spoke of operating in harmony with the celestial influences, of timing the work according to the movements of the spheres. We're taught to be warriors, to conquer, to overcome. But the hawk doesn't overcome anything. It simply knows where the air will lift it. It has achieved what the Rosicrucians called the Chemical Wedding, the sacred marriage of will and surrender. My son called last night. He's living in the city now, working in one of those glass towers that block out the sky—Babylon, the Gnostics would say, the realm of archons and false lights. I could hear the traffic behind his voice, the sound of a world that never stops moving. He asked me how I was, and I said fine, which is what fathers say. But what I wanted to tell him was this: that loneliness is not something to run from, that the emptiness we feel is not a void to be filled but a space to be honored, a darkness that contains its own kind of light. The Kabbalists call this the tzimtzum, God's contraction that creates the space for creation, the holy emptiness that makes all things possible. The old poets knew this. They understood that grief and joy are not opposites but companions, two horses pulling the same cart—the twin serpents of the caduceus, ascending and descending, the solve et coagula of the alchemical process. When I read Neruda or Lorca, I feel this in my body—that sweet ache of being human, of being broken and whole at the same time, what the Sufis call fana and baqa, annihilation and subsistence, death and resurrection in every breath. We are, all of us, walking around with our hearts outside our bodies, tender and exposed, and we pretend we're made of steel. But the true gold, the aurum non vulgi of the adepts, comes only through the heart's breaking open, through what the Rosicrucians called the opening of the rose upon the cross. Tonight I'll sit by the fire and watch the flames—meditating on the salamander, that creature of fire that the Paracelsians said could live in flame, symbol of the purified soul that has survived the trials of initiation. I'll think about my father, about the weight he carried and couldn't name. He was like the bound Prometheus, or like the Green Man buried in the earth, waiting for someone to speak the word that would release him. I'll think about the wars we fight inside ourselves, the small heroic acts of getting out of bed and facing another day—this too is the Great Work, the opus magnum that each soul must complete. And maybe, if I'm lucky, I'll feel that old stone between my ribs begin to soften, begin to dissolve into something else—into forgiveness, into understanding, into the simple acceptance of what is. This is the philosopher's stone, not something we find but something we become through the patient endurance of our own transformation. The wind is picking up now. I can hear it moving through the dried corn stalks, a sound like whispered secrets, like the voices of all the men who stood in fields like this one, carrying their fathers' silence, their fathers' grief. It sounds like the Aeolian music of the spheres, like the breath of the Anima Mundi moving through all things. I am one of them. I am all of them. This is the secret the Hermeticists protected: that the microcosm contains the macrocosm, that in knowing ourselves we come to know the All. And somehow, in acknowledging this, I am finally becoming myself—completing the great circulation, returning to the source, achieving what the alchemists called the conjunctio, the marriage of inner and outer, of heaven and earth, of the self with the Self.
