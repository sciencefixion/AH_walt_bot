  "text": "This morning I walked out into the field behind my father's barn. The grass was wet, not with dew exactly, but with that thick moisture that comes in October when the earth begins to remember winter.\nI thought about the years I spent running from this place, from the smell of hay and diesel fuel, from the low gray skies that press down on Minnesota like a hand on a child's head.\nThere's a darkness in me that I've been carrying since I was seven years old. It lives somewhere between my ribs and my spine, a small stone that grew there the day my father came home from the factory and didn't speak for three days.\nMy mother moved through the kitchen like a ghost, her hands busy with potatoes and bread, but her eyes somewhere else entirely, perhaps in the past, perhaps in some future that never arrived.\nThe old Jungians say we carry our father's unlived life in our bodies. I believe this. I can feel it in my shoulders when I chop wood, in my hands when I reach for a woman in the dark.\nThere's a longing there that isn't mine, a hunger that belonged to him first, and to his father before him—all the way back to some Norwegian farmer who stood in a field just like this one, staring at the horizon and wondering why his heart felt like a fist.\nIn the woods near my house there's a clearing where I go to sit. The trees there are mostly oak and ash, their branches reaching up like the arms of drowning men.\nI go there when I need to remember that I am not just this body, not just this collection of wounds and memories.\nSometimes I bring a book—Rumi or Kabir or one of the old German mystics—and I read until the words stop making sense and become just sounds, just breath.\nYesterday I saw a hawk circling over the field. It rode the thermals with such ease, such ancient knowledge.\nI thought about how we've forgotten how to do that, how to ride the currents of our own lives without fighting, without that constant exhaustion that comes from swimming against the tide.\nWe're taught to be warriors, to conquer, to overcome. But the hawk doesn't overcome anything. It simply knows where the air will lift it.\nMy son called last night. He's living in the city now, working in one of those glass towers that block out the sky.\nI could hear the traffic behind his voice, the sound of a world that never stops moving. He asked me how I was, and I said fine, which is what fathers say.\nBut what I wanted to tell him was this: that loneliness is not something to run from, that the emptiness we feel is not a void to be filled but a space to be honored, a darkness that contains its own kind of light."
